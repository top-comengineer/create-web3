# Deploy Script

Inside the hardhat/deploy folder are where deploy scripts are run from. As you see, there is a script called `00_deploy_contract.js`

```jsx
module.exports = async ({ getNamedAccounts, deployments }) => {
  const { deploy } = deployments;
  const { deployer } = await getNamedAccounts();

  const args = ["Hello!!!!!!!!"];

  await deploy("Greeter", {
    // Learn more about args here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy#deploymentsdeploy
    args: args,
    from: deployer,
    log: true,
  });
};
module.exports.tags = ["Greeter"];
```

The args array passes arguments into the the Greeter.sol contract's constructor.

```jsx
constructor(string memory _greeting) {
    greeting = _greeting;
}
```

This constructor takes a single string arugment. Passing ["Hello!!!!!!!!"], sets the

```jsx
string private greeting;
```

to "Hello!!!!!!!!"

To deploy another contract, create another file incrementing the filename ie `01_deploy_another_contract`

When you run the deploy script, each deploy script will run async from lowest number to highest. This gives the advantage to deploy multiple contracts and using a previous deployed contact's address in a script to pass into another contract.
