## Setting Solidity Versions

create-web3 ships with configuration for `solidity version 0.8.10`

```jsx
module.exports = {
  solidity: '0.8.10',

...
}
```

If your contract requires another version of solidity, you will need to make a change to your hardhat.config file.
You can simply change versions here.

If you have contracts that require multiple versions of solidity to compile, change solidity to an object to add and array of compiler versions

```jsx
module.exports = {
  // solidity: "0.8.10",
  solidity: {
    compilers: [
      {
        version: "0.8.10",
      },
      {
        version: "0.6.0",
      },
    ],
  },

...
}
```
