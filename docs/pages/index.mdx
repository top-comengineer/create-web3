# Create Web3

### Welcome ðŸ˜ƒ

ðŸ§± & ðŸš€ more

Setting up a project takes a lot of time, so I created `create-web3` to help others quickly get a starting point to either test an idea or build their dapp.

I hope this helps you get up and going quickly and so you can focus on creating something great! ðŸ˜ƒ

This guide is a work in progress

### Version

Current Version [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/create-web3)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-web3)

When using `npx create-web3` you are saving this package locally on your machine. To check the version on your machine run

`npx create-web3 --version`

To install the latest version, run

`npm install --global create-web3`

### Overview

This project was created as a quick start boilerplate for developing web3 apps and deploying smart contracts.

The bolierplate sets up a monorepo that keeps the front-end environment (NextJS) and the contract environment (Hardhat) seperate from each other.
The advantage to setting up in this way, is that packages and libraries are kept seperate, and reduces clutter when developing.

The bolierplate does NOT include any CSS frameworks. There too many opinonated views on which framework to use, it's better that YOU, the user, decides what you like working with best.
