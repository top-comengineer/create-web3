# Quick Start

First start by opening your terminal and typing :

```jsx
npx create-web3
```

1. Name your project.

2. Choose install by using NPM or YARN

3. Choose project create with Javascript or Typescript

When finished now install packages

For NPM type:

```jsx
npm install
```

For YARN type:

```jsx
yarn install
```

Once packages are installed `cd` into the directory of your project

To start your local hardhat environment, run:

for npm

```jsx
npm run chain
```

for yarn

```jsx
yarn chain
```

Now open another terminal, `cd` into the directory of your project, and deploy the Greetor.sol contract

for npm

```jsx
npm run deploy
```

for yarn

```jsx
yarn deploy
```

Now in the same terminal start your Front End by running:

for npm

```jsx
npm run dev
```

for yarn

```jsx
yarn dev
```

import Callout from "nextra-theme-docs/callout";

<Callout emoji="ðŸš€">
  Now open your browser and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
</Callout>

### Congratulations!!!

### You've just setup your local development environment and deployed a contract locally

You can now connect a wallet and interact with the Greeter contract by typing in a new message.
